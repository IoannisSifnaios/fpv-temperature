# Floating Photovoltaics (FPV) temperature models

This repository contains Python implementations of various FPV models from the literature. Specifically, the included models are:

* [Lindholm](scripts/Lindholm.py) [1]
* [Rahaman](scripts/Rahaman.py) [2]
* [Kamuyu](scripts/Kamuyu.py) [3]
* [Hayibo](scripts/Hayibo.py) [4]

Additionally, there are functions for estimating the [thermal properties of water and air](scripts/properties.py)
